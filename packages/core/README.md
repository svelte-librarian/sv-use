```

For more information and documentation, see the [official website](https://svelte-librarian.github.io/sv-use).

## FAQ

1. Aren't there other libraries that do this already ?  
   Yes there are. However, most of the libraries haven't transitioned to Svelte 5.
1. Why use this one instead of [`svecosystem/runed`](https://github.com/svecosystem/runed) (or other libraries) ?
   1. I wanted to make a library that had a lot of utilities to the level of [vueuse/vueuse](https://github.com/vueuse/vueuse) and/or [streamich/react-use](https://github.com/streamich/react-use). It's not there yet, but it's slowly growing.
   1. I'm not a big fan of using the `use` prefix *everywhere*, especially when other verbs could be more descriptive.

## Acknowledgements

Though it's not a 1:1 port, I heavily took inspiration from these libraries to adapt the library for the Svelte ecosystem :

-   [vueuse/vueuse](https://github.com/vueuse/vueuse)
-   [streamich/react-use](https://github.com/streamich/react-use)
-   [svecosystem/runed](https://github.com/svecosystem/runed)
